# Booking.com_GoogleCalander
This script combined with booking.com_scraper (partner account ) creates google calendar events , reservation event,check-in and check-out with all the data like number, name, reservation id , property name etc.  
## Overview

The Booking.com Calendar Integration project allows you to synchronize booking data from Booking.com with Google Calendar, providing a seamless experience for managing reservations, check-ins, and check-outs.

## Features

- **Automatic Integration**: Booking data is automatically fetched and integrated into Google Calendar, ensuring real-time updates.
- **Color-Coded Events**: Events are color-coded for easy identification based on reservation status.
- **Detailed Information**: Each event contains detailed information about the reservation, including guest name, phone number, and property details.
- **Check-In and Check-Out**: Separate events for check-ins and check-outs make managing guest arrivals and departures straightforward.
- **Conflict Resolution**: If a reservation status changes or conflicts with an existing event, the system updates or removes events accordingly.
- **OAuth2 Authentication**: Secure OAuth2 authentication with Google Calendar API for data access.

create a gitignore so that its doesnt commit packages to git
ChatGPT
To create a .gitignore file that excludes node_modules (packages) from being committed to your Git repository, follow these steps:

Open a text editor or code editor.

Create a new file named .gitignore in the root directory of your Git repository if it doesn't already exist.

Add the following line to your .gitignore file:

bash
Copy code
/node_modules/
This line tells Git to ignore the node_modules directory and its contents.

Save the .gitignore file.

Your .gitignore file should look like this:

plaintext
Copy code
/node_modules/
Now, when you commit changes to your repository, the node_modules directory will be excluded from the commit, which is the recommended practice for Node.js projects to keep the repository size manageable.

how to push code to already created git repo
ChatGPT
To push your code to an already created Git repository, follow these steps:

Navigate to Your Project Directory: Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the local directory where your project files are located. You should be inside the root directory of your project.

Initialize Git (If Not Already Done): If your project is not already a Git repository, you can initialize it by running the following command:

bash
Copy code
git init
This command initializes a new Git repository in the current directory.

Add Files to the Staging Area: Before you can commit and push your code, you need to add the files you want to include in the commit to the staging area. You can do this using the git add command. For example, to add all files, you can use:

bash
Copy code
git add .
If you only want to add specific files, replace . with the file names or paths.

Commit Your Changes: After adding files to the staging area, you need to commit them with a meaningful commit message. Use the git commit command like this:

bash
Copy code
git commit -m "Your commit message here"
Replace "Your commit message here" with a concise description of the changes you made.

Add a Remote Repository: To push your code to a remote repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab), you need to add a remote repository URL. If you haven't already added a remote, you can do so with the following command:

bash
Copy code
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
Replace https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git with the URL of your remote Git repository.

Push Your Code: Finally, you can push your code to the remote repository using the git push command:

bash
Copy code
git push -u origin master
This command pushes the code from the local master branch to the remote repository named origin. If your branch is named differently, replace master with the correct branch name.

Enter Your Credentials: If prompted, enter your GitHub (or other Git host) username and password or a personal access token for authentication.

Verify on the Remote Host: After successfully pushing your code, you can visit your remote repository on the hosting platform (e.g., GitHub) to verify that your code has been uploaded.

That's it! Your code is now pushed to the remote Git repository. You can continue to push new changes using the git push command whenever you make updates to your project.

after doing this its added as new branch how to merge with main
ChatGPT
If you've pushed your code to a new branch and want to merge it into the main branch (or any other target branch), you can follow these steps:

Switch to the Target Branch: First, switch to the branch you want to merge your changes into (e.g., main):

bash
Copy code
git checkout main
Replace main with the name of your target branch.

Merge the Feature Branch: Once you're on the target branch, use the git merge command to merge your feature branch into it:

bash
Copy code
git merge your-feature-branch
Replace your-feature-branch with the actual name of the branch you want to merge into main.

Resolve Conflicts (If Any): If Git encounters conflicts during the merge, you'll need to resolve them manually. Git will mark the conflicted files, and you can use a text editor or a merge tool to resolve the conflicts. After resolving conflicts, save the files.

Commit the Merge: After resolving conflicts (if any), commit the changes resulting from the merge:

bash
Copy code
git commit -m "Merge branch 'your-feature-branch' into main"
This commit message should indicate that you've merged your feature branch into main.

Push the Changes: Finally, push the merged changes to the remote repository:

bash
Copy code
git push origin main
This command pushes the changes in the main branch to the remote repository.

Your feature branch changes are now merged into the main branch, and your local and remote repositories are updated accordingly.
